## 2. Performance
- ✅ Implement lazy loading or pagination for product grid to improve load times
- ✅ Minimize JS/CSS resources for faster page loads

## 3. Functional Stability
- ✅ Fix issue where cart doesn't clear after placing/removing items
- ✅ Add confirmation message ID or class for easier test automation
- ✅ Ensure unique product identifiers on UI for consistent interaction

## 4. Accessibility
- ✅ Use semantic HTML tags (e.g., `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`) for better screen reader support
- ✅ Add `aria-labels` and proper tab indexing for forms and navigation

## 5. Automation Support
- ✅ Add test IDs or `data-testid` attributes to critical buttons and links
- ✅ Improve element consistency in modals and alerts for stable locators
