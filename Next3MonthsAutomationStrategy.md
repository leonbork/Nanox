# 3-Month Automation Strategy Plan

## Month 1 – Foundation & Critical Flows
- 🔧 Finalize project structure with Page Object Model (POM)
- ⚙️ Integrate Allure and TestNG
- 🔐 Set up CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions)
- ✅ Implement critical flows: Login, Add to Cart, Place Order

## Month 2 – Coverage Expansion
- 🧪 Add scenarios for:
    - Failed logins
    - Empty cart behavior
    - Category navigation and product filtering
- 🗂 Introduce test data management (Faker or external files)
- 🧼 Add negative and boundary test cases

## Month 3 – Optimization & Maintenance
- 🧵 Parallel test execution and cross-browser support (e.g., via Selenium Grid or cloud tools)
- 🔄 Integrate with bug tracking or test management tools (optional)
- 🔁 Add smoke and regression suites
- 📈 Monitor flakiness, test run durations, and failure trends

## Tools Consideration
- 💡 Add Playwright for UI reliability or REST-assured/Postman for API testing
- 🔧 Docker for consistent local environment
- 📊 Allure or ReportPortal for richer reporting
